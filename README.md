## Deploying Your Backend Like a CDN With Wasm
This repository includes all the application components I used for my talk, including some information about the components themselves and how you can run the examples on your own.

### Talk Abstract
Content delivery networks (CDNs) drastically improve the performance, availability and reliability of delivering web content to users. With strategically placed distributed edge networks, they are designed to cache, load balance and respond to requests based on geographic affinity. CDNs work very well for frontends, but the wide variety of backend infrastructure, platform requirements and architecture setups would never work in a CDN. Until now. With WebAssembly (Wasm), cloud-native backends can be distributed and run just as easily as displaying static assets to frontend users. This talk will demonstrate how this platform-agnostic binary format can run polyglot backends in the cloud, on the edge, even in a web browser tab. Full of engaging demos, the talk will focus on wasmCloud, the CNCF application runtime, and how it combines the security and performance of Wasm, with the distributed network of NATS, to create a robust backend CDN.
